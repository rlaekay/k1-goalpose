## Installation

HTWK Gym uses Python virtual environments for flexible dependency management. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8:

    ```sh
    $ python3.8 -m venv venv_isaac
    $ source venv_isaac/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install PyTorch with CUDA support:

    ```sh
    $ pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.0 torchaudio==2.0.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```

3. Install Isaac Gym

    Download Isaac Gym from [NVIDIA's website](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym/download).

    Extract and install:

    ```sh
    $ tar -xzvf IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz
    $ cd isaacgym/python
    $ pip install -e .
    ```

4. Install Python dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. (Optional) Install TensorFlow Lite export dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ pip install tensorflow==2.16.1 onnx onnx-tf
    ```

    This enables TensorFlow Lite model export for mobile and embedded deployment.

## Usage

### 1. Training

HTWK Gym supports multiple robot platforms and task types. To start training a policy:

```sh
$ python train.py --task=T1/BaseWalk
```

#### Available Task Options:
- **T1 Platform**: `T1/BaseWalk`, `T1/ParameterWalk`, `T1/Kicking`
- **K1 Platform**: `K1/ParameterWalk`

Training logs and saved models will be stored in `logs/<robot_type>/<task_name>/<timestamp>/`.

#### Configurations

Training settings are loaded from `envs/<task>.yaml`. You can also override config values using command-line arguments:

- `--checkpoint`: Path of the model checkpoint to load (set to `-1` to use the most recent model).
- `--num_envs`: Number of environments to create.
- `--headless`: Run headless without creating a viewer window.
- `--sim_device`: Device for physics simulation (e.g., `cuda:0`, `cpu`). 
- `--rl_device`: Device for the RL algorithm (e.g., `cuda:0`, `cpu`). 
- `--seed`: Random seed.
- `--max_iterations`: Maximum number of training iterations.

To add a new task, create a config file in `envs/` and register the environment in `envs/__init__.py`.

#### Progress Tracking

To visualize training progress with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), run:

```sh
$ tensorboard --logdir logs
```

This will show logs organized by robot type and task name in the hierarchical structure.

To use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for tracking, log in first:

```sh
$ wandb login
```

You can disable W&B tracking by setting `use_wandb` to `false` in the config file.

---

### 2. Playing

#### In-Simulation Testing

To test the trained policy in Isaac Gym, run:

```sh
$ python play.py --task=T1/BaseWalk --checkpoint=-1
```

Videos of the evaluation are automatically saved in `videos/<date-time>.mp4`. You can disable video recording by setting `record_video` to `false` in the config file.

#### Cross-Simulation Testing

To test the policy in MuJoCo, run:

```sh
$ python play_mujoco.py --task=T1/BaseWalk --checkpoint=-1
```

---

### 3. Deployment

HTWK Gym supports multiple deployment formats for different target platforms:

#### PyTorch JIT Export
For standard PyTorch deployment:
```sh
$ python export_model.py --task=T1/BaseWalk --checkpoint=-1
```

#### TensorFlow Lite Export
For deployment in the HTWK Firmware or other tflite based executers:
```sh
# Basic TFLite export
$ python export_tflite.py --task=T1/BaseWalk --checkpoint=-1
```

#### Real-Time Robot Deployment
For direct deployment to physical robots with live parameter control:



**Deployment Options:**
- **Intel Board (Recommended)**: Deploy directly on the robot's Intel board for the easiest setup with no network latency
- **Simulation**: Use [Webots](https://booster.feishu.cn/wiki/DtFgwVXYxiBT8BksUPjcOwG4n4f#share-IsE9d2DrIow8tpxCBUUcogdwn5d) or [Isaac Sim](https://booster.feishu.cn/wiki/DtFgwVXYxiBT8BksUPjcOwG4n4f#share-Jczjd4UKMou7QlxjvJ4c9NNfnwb) for simulation testing



**Transfer Files to Robot:**

3. **Copy deploy folder to robot (Intel Board recommanded):**
   ```sh
   $ scp -r deploy/ <username>@<robot_ip>:/<destination>/
   ```

**Setup on Robot:**

4. **SSH into robot:**
   ```sh
   $ ssh <username>@<robot_ip>
   ```

5. **Navigate to deployment directory and create virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   $ cd /<destination>/deploy
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

6. **Install dependencies in virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Install Booster Robotics SDK (if not already installed):**
   
   Follow the [Booster Robotics SDK Guide](https://booster.feishu.cn/wiki/DtFgwVXYxiBT8BksUPjcOwG4n4f) and complete the section on [Compile Sample Programs and Install Python SDK](https://booster.feishu.cn/wiki/DtFgwVXYxiBT8BksUPjcOwG4n4f#share-EI5fdtSucoJWO4xd49QcE5CInSf).

**Prepare Robot:**

8. **Before starting deployment:**
   - Power on the robot
   - Switch robot to **PREP Mode**
   - Place robot in a stable standing position in an open area

**Execute Deployment:**

9. **Activate virtual environment and start deployment scripts on robot:**
   ```sh
   # Activate the venv (if starting a new SSH session)
   $ cd /<destination>/deploy
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Basic walking deployment
   $ python deploy_base_walk.py --config=Base_Walk.yaml --net=127.0.0.1

   # OR Parameterized walking with real-time control
   $ python deploy_parameter_walk.py --config=Parameter_Walk.yaml --net=127.0.0.1
   ```
   If you are not deploying on the Intel Board you need to set the ``--net`` to the correct address of the fast dds.

10. **Launch Streamlit observation editor on robot (for parameterized walking):**
   ```sh
   # Ensure venv is activated
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ streamlit run streamlit_observation_editor.py
   ```
   
11. **Access the control interface from your web browser:**
    - Open your browser on your development machine
    - Navigate to `http://<robot_ip>:8501` to access the real-time control interface
    - The Streamlit app runs on the robot and serves the web interface remotely

**Exit Safely:**

12. **To stop deployment:**
    - Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully terminate deployment scripts
    - Switch robot back to **PREP Mode** before turning off or moving robot

#### Pre-trained Models
HTWK Gym includes pre-trained models in the `deploy/models/` directory:
- `base_walk.pt` - T1 robot base walking policy
- `parameter_walk.pt` - Parameterized walking policy
- Additional specialized models for different behaviors

After exporting the model, follow the steps in [Deploy on Booster Robot](deploy/README.md) to complete the deployment process.

**Key Features:**
- Live parameter control via web browser
- Real-time monitoring of robot status
- Intuitive slider-based interface
- Configuration management and export capabilities

For detailed usage instructions, see the [Deploy on Booster Robot](deploy/README.md) documentation.
